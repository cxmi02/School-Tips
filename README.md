# School-Tips
This repository contains an API developed with NestJS and TypeORM for managing school tips. The API allows creating, updating, deleting (soft delete), and querying school tips. Additionally, it supports paginated queries and filtering by subject and level. PostgreSQL is the database used, and the API is deployed in a public cloud.
